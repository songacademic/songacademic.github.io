I'm a last-year Ph.D. student at Clemson University, and my research interests include IoT security/privacy and online abuse detection. Specifically, my work is focused on exploring the security and privacy of Voice Personal Assistants (VPA), such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. I consider myself fortunate to have the opportunity to work under the guidance of Dr. [Long Cheng](https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~lcheng2/), whose expertise and guidance have been invaluable to my work.

Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I earned both my bachelor's and master's degrees from Xi'an Jiaotong University, where I had the opportunity to work in the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (IAIR) and work with Dr.Yuehu Liu.

<font color="red">I will join Texas Tech University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students. Please email me your CV if you are interested in my work.</font><br/>
