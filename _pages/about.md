I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Texas Tech University. My research interests include IoT security/privacy and data science. Specifically, my work is focused on exploring the security and privacy of Voice Personal Assistants (VPA), such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.

I earned my Ph.D. from Clemson University, where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Dr. [Long Cheng](https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~lcheng2/). Before pursuing my Ph.D., I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees at Xi'an Jiaotong University, where I conducted research at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (IAIR) under the mentorship of Dr. Yuehu Liu.

<font color="red"> I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students. Please email me your CV if you are interested in my work.</font><br/>
